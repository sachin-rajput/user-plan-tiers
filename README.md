Thank you for taking the time to complete the Vimeo Payments Team Coding Challenge!

There are a few ground rules:

- Plan to take about an hour, but please don't spend more than two
- This is completely open book -- Feel free to lookup anything you like online
- Use any tools, languages, or external libraries you like

Please email back your completed code and a simple README file that explains how to run the code.
